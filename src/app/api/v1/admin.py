"""The operator's contract: the invite queue, inviting from it in a batch, the daily totals of
accounts and sign-ins, and curating the species catalog's photos.

**The first routes in `/api/v1` to be superuser-gated.** `is_superuser` has existed on
`User` since the beginning and until now gated exactly one thing - the docs router on
`staging` (`core/setup.py`). The routes here are the second, and they are gated by a
**router-level** dependency rather than per handler, so the route-walking auth guard
(`tests/helpers/routes.py`, which reads include-level dependencies through the merged
dependant) sees the marker on every route here without each one naming it, and a route
added to this module later cannot arrive unprotected.

**Not the CRUDAdmin panel, and not a page.** These are ordinary JSON routes; the UI that
drives them is a superuser-gated section of the web app. The deciding argument is auth:
this app has no passwords, the access token is a bearer header held in browser memory and
the refresh cookie is single-use and `SameSite=lax`, so a browser *navigating* to a
server-rendered admin page on this origin carries no credential this app recognises. That
leaves an API-side admin either keeping a second identity with its own password, which is
what CRUDAdmin is, or building a cookie-to-page auth bridge nobody else ships.

The web gate is a convenience over this one and never a substitute: a non-superuser is
refused here whatever page they came from.
